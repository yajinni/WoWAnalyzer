            While constantly casting heals will quickly run you out of mana, you should still try to always be doing something throughout the fight. You can reduce your downtime while saving mana by spamming <SpellLink id={SPELLS.SOLAR_WRATH.id} /> on the boss when there is nothing serious to heal. If you safely healed through the entire fight and still had high non-healing time, your raid team is probably bringing too many healers.
