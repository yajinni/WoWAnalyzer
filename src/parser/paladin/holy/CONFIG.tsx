      Hey! The Holy Paladin analyzer is one of the most maintained specs on the site. It gets updated quickly with new things, and has most things implemented that can be analyzed automatically with good enough accuracy. If you think anything is off or wrong, please contact me @Zerotorescue so we can discuss it. I don't mind double or triple checking something if there's any doubt.<br /><br />

      I hope the suggestions will help you improve your performance. Remember: focus on improving only one or two important things at a time. Improving isn't easy and will need your full focus until it becomes second nature to you.<br /><br />

      You might have noticed the suggestions focus mostly on improving your cast efficiencies. This might seem silly, but it's actually one of the most important things for us Holy Paladins. Avoid having your <SpellLink id={SPELLS.AVENGING_WRATH.id} /> and other cooldowns available unused for long periods of time (they're not raid cooldowns, they're required for you to have decent throughput and not run OOM) and <b>hit those buttons</b> that have short cooldowns (such as <SpellLink id={SPELLS.HOLY_SHOCK_CAST.id} /> and <SpellLink id={SPELLS.LIGHT_OF_DAWN_CAST.id} />). Ohh and don't cast <SpellLink id={SPELLS.LIGHT_OF_THE_MARTYR.id} /> unless there's nothing else to cast.<br /><br />

      If you want to learn more about Holy Paladins, join the Paladin community at the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/hammerofwrath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hammer of Wrath discord</a>. The <kbd>#holy-faq</kbd> channel has a lot of useful information including links to good guides.
