 * `type: 1` seems to only be used by Falling, but I was unable to verify this. I want to ignore this kind of damage taken. I figured the savest solution would be to filter by ability id instead of type, but if you find another such ability that needs to be ignored and it has `type: 1` while nothing else does, we may want to refactor this.

        The total estimated damage reduced <strong>by the passive</strong> was{' '}

        has high accuracy.

        The total estimated damage reduced <strong>during Aura Mastery</strong> was{' '}
        {formatThousands(this.activeDamageReduced)} ({formatNumber(this.activeDrps)} DRPS). This has
        a 99% accuracy.
        <br />
        <br />
        This value is calculated using the <i>Optional DRs</i> method. This results in the lowest
        possible damage reduction value being shown. This should be the correct value in most
        circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        Calculating the exact damage reduced by Devotion Aura is very time and resource consuming.
        This method uses a very close estimation. The active damage reduced is calculated by taking
        the total damage taken of the entire raid during <SpellLink
          id={SPELLS.AURA_MASTERY.id}
        />{' '}
        and calculating the damage reduced during this time. The passive damage reduction is
        calculated by taking the exact damage reduction factor applicable and calculating the damage
        reduced if that full effect was applied to the Paladin. Even though the passive damage
        reduction is split among other nearby players, using your personal damage taken should
        average it out very closely. More extensive tests that go over all damage events have shown
        that this is usually a close approximation.
