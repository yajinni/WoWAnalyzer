 * Calculating Holy Avenger healing contribution is hard.
 *
 * What this does is add 30% of all effective healing and 30% of Holy Shock effective healing for the total healing contributed by Holy Avenger. There is no checking for GCDs missed or whatever since the assumption is that you still cast 30% more spells than you normally would, and normally you'd also have missed GCDs.
 *
 * This healing gain from the Haste is kinda undervalued since Haste gains are calculated in-game with <code>CurrentHaste * (1 + HasteBonus) + HasteBonus</code>. Here all I include is the absolute Haste bonus, not the relative bonus since it's hard to calculate.
 *
 * This statistic can see high numbers if Holy Avenger is paired with Avenging Wrath and/or AoS Aura Masatery. **This is perfectly right.** Those spells increase the ST/cleave healing you do and work nicely with a Haste increaser that increases the amount of heals you can do in that short period of time. But stacking HA with AW/AM may still not be best when you look at the overall fight, as spread out cooldowns often still provide more effective healing.
