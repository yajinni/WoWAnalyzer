/**
 * Options:
 *
 * A. Get average regardless of health or amount.
 * This gets the average based on just the range per heal. This ignores the heal amount and ignores the health pool of the target. A 999 tiny heals and 1 huge heal will get a linear average based on the 1000 heals. This means the result will lean more towards the tiny heals.
 *
 * B. Get average adjusted for healing amount.
 * This gets the average based on the amount healed. This ignores the health pool of the target (and thus overhealing). A 999 tiny heals and 1 huge heal will lean more towards the huge heal.
 *
 * C. Get average adjusted for target health.
 * This gets the average based on the target's health and potential overhealing. Any overhealing is excluded for the max potential. Image you cast a heal where the mastery gain was 90 healing at 50% effectiveness (based on range). After the heal, the target only has 10 health missing. In this situation the total potential mastery gain would be considered 100. This gives you a 90% adjusted effectiveness (instead of the 50% based on range).
 *
 * D. Get average adjusted for target health and amount.
 * Combines B and C so that 100 potential mastery gain is valued much less than 1,000 potential.
 *
 * Option A might incorrectly inflate the mastery effectiveness due to certain tiny heals having high effectiveness while they might unevenly contribute to total healing. In addition other tools using this to calculate stat weights do so based on total average healing done and have no idea about tiny heals potentially having better mastery effectiveness.
 * Option C doesn't have any benefits for this statistic or outside of it. This mastery effectiveness can not be used for stat weights as stat weights already account for overhealing and it would throw off the calculation. It's also misleading for analysis for various reasons.
 * Option D suffers from the same problems as option C, but with the benefits from option B.
 * Option B is the best choice. It gets the right average both for analysis and for stat weights. It's the most natural.
