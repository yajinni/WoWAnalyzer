      <Warning>
        Hey there! A good basis has been implemented for this spec, but it needs to be fleshed out more to provide all the feedback possible.<br /><br />
        This spec needs a focused maintainer. If you want to give it a try, check <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer">GitHub</a> for more information.
      </Warning>
      <Warning>
      Hi <kbd>@Tsabo</kbd> here. Due to some incorrect data coming out of WarcraftLogs for Outlaw beta logs, combo points generated by Sinister Strike and Pistol Shot may be incorrect. I will verify this once PrePatch is live.
      </Warning>
