      Welcome to the Frost Mage analyzer! We hope the suggestions and statistics displayed here will help you improve your gameplay. Playing a Frost Mage revolves heavily around making the most of your talents (like <SpellLink id={SPELLS.GLACIAL_SPIKE_TALENT.id} /> or <SpellLink id={SPELLS.THERMAL_VOID_TALENT.id} />) and procs (like <SpellLink id={SPELLS.BRAIN_FREEZE.id} /> and <SpellLink id={SPELLS.FINGERS_OF_FROST.id} />), so that's the majority of what you'll see analyzed here.<br /><br />

      We are always looking to improve, so if you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, please <a href="https://github.com/WoWAnalyzer/WoWAnalyzer/issues/new?labels=Mage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open an issue</a> on GitHub or send us a message on the <a href="https://wowanalyzer.com/discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WoWAnalyzer Discord</a>.<br /><br />
