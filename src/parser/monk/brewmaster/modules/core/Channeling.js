/**
 * Crackling Jade Lightning don't reveal in the combatlog when channeling begins and ends, this fabricates the required events so that ABC can handle it properly.
 * Combatlog event order is messy, it often looks like:
 * 1. applydebuff Crackling Jade Lightning
 * 2. begincast/cast new spell
 * 3. removedebuff Crackling Jade Lightning
 * To avoid Crackling Jade Lightning as being marked "canceled" when we start a new spell we mark it as ended instead on the begincast/cast.
