 *
 * Situations where <5 combo point use of an ability is fine:
 *  Fresh Rip on a target which doesn't yet have it.
 *  Rip on a target that already has Rip if it upgrades the snapshot, so long as player is using Sabertooth.
 *  [NYI] Maim on a target where the stun is effective and useful.
 *  [NYI] Possibly when using Savage Roar? Will need theorycrafting.
