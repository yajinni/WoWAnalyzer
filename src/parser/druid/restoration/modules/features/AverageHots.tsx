            This is the average number of mastery stacks your heals benefitted from, weighted by healing done. It can help show how much mileage you're getting out of your mastery.<br /><br />

            Not all of this number is within your control. Having to do a lot of tank healing or speccing for Cultivation and/or Spring Blossoms tends to produce higher average mastery stacks, while playing in larger raid groups tends to produce lower average mastery stacks.<br /><br />

            This number counts all your healing, even heals that don't benefit from your mastery (like most trinkets). Your average mastery stacks counting only heals that benefit from mastery is <strong>{avgDruidHots}</strong>.
