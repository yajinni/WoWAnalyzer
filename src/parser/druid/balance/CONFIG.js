      Hello Moonkins! This tool is intended to show major statistics and potential issues in your rotation. Please mind that it can always be improved upon, so if you see anything that you disagree with or think is missing please let us know!<br /><br />

      As a rule of thumb: Never overcap Astral Power, don't overcap empowerments and keep your dots up on the target(s) at all times. Remember to pool Astral Power prior to movement.<br /><br />

      If you want to learn more about how to play Moonkin, visit <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/0dWu0WkuetF87H9H" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamGrove, the Druid's Discord</a> or <a href="https://dreamgrove.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamGrove.gg</a>.
