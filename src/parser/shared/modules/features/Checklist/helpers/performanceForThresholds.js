/**
 *   0 - 33% major This is different from the *minor* threshold which is at 100% instead of 66%. The reason for this is that the minor threshold being at 75% and then 75%-100% being minor - max is that this would suggest going for max is best while this is not always the case. Something like Crusader Strike (with the Crusader's Might talent) has a recommended cast efficiency of 35% *because* you should only cast it enough to benefit you, more than that would be good but not 100% cast efficiency as then you're losing healing.
 * 33% - 66% average
 * 66% - 99% minor
 * 100% good (no issue)
