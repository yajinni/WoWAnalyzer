/**
 * This analyzer adds the cost of a specific resource type to cast events, and allows that cost to
 * be adjusted from what's given in the combat log. Typically the combat log doesn't apply resource
 * cost reductions so we need to check for conditions and apply it ourselves. Using SpellResourceCost
 * allows you to apply that reduction just once and have the information available wherever the cast
 * event gets processed.
 *
 * If you're dealing with mana you should use parser/core/Modules/SpellManaCost instead.
 *
 * An example implementation can be found at parser/Druid/Feral/Modules/Features/SpellEnergyCost
 * Check the "IMPLEMENTME" comments for what typically needs to be customised.
