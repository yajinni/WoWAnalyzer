    WoWAnalyzer is a tool to help you analyze and improve your World of Warcraft raiding performance through various relevant metrics and gameplay suggestions.<br /><br />

    We give detailed insight into various things such as cast behavior, buff uptimes, downtime, cooldown usage, wasted resources and more.
